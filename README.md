GITHUB STREAM CLIENT
=====================
## Description
```
There are a bunch of APIs available for all sorts of data. Many things today are written as single-page applications (SPA) using “web technologies”. They are today available as webpages or even downloadable applications.

For those who code for a living, an API is as much of a UI as anything with shapes and colors. However, we would like to create a user interface that will display the result of an API-call in an way that's approachable for a non-coder.

## Total number of versions
The entire code base is split into three versions (version:1.0,1.1, 1.2)<br>

### Version:1.0
In here we create an aplication which shows issues regarding the javascript oldest to newest and newest at first.It would fetch immediatly after entering the page
### `git checkout version1.0 for 1.0`

### Version:1.1
In here we improve the user interface making it clear enough for the user to understand and also removing the HTML tags adding the read more option and also perform styling for better user interface
### `git checkout version1.1 for 1.1`

### Version:1.2
This is the final version of the project and we add the streaming functionality to the application without user interaction we can see the latest issues first
### `git checkout master for 1.2`
